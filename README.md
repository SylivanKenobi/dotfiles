# LinuxDotFiles
This repository is part of the ansible-archlinux setup. It contains all my personal linux dotfiles.
All content is managed by [rcm](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos).

The ansible setup will install this repo to ~/.dotfiles and rcm will take care
of all symlinks.
